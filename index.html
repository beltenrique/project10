        My favorite hobby is coding because coding is fun for me. 
        Coding opened many doors in my life and introduced me to new coding platforms 
        like Visual Studio, java, and Codepen, which is where I made my first personal website.
         Coding gave me a new life, and learning it still gives me pleasure. Also,
        I have learned to type very well on the keyboard, so I especially love text coding over block coding.
        Anyway, I love coding, and I will always remember it as my favorite hobby, and I will never,
        ever forget what I have learned and what I will learn later on in life.

        <h2>Why your new Apple iPhone 15 is overheating?</h2>
        <p><img class="elementimg" src="iphone.png" alt="iphone image">
          iPhone users have come to expect their devices to become hotter during the initial set-up or 
          when they are being backed up, due to the amount of processing power being used and the handset 
          working overtime - but these issues with the iPhone 15 have been worse.
          Apple said that the device may feel warmer in the first few days "after setting up or restoring 
          the device because of increased background activity. "The company said: "We have identified a few
           conditions which can cause iPhones to run warmer than expected."</p>

        <h2>Meta announces AI chatbots with 'personality'</h2>
        <p><img class="elementimg" src="zuck.jpg" alt="Zuckerberg image">
           Meta has announced a series of new chatbots to be used in its Messenger service. The chatbots will
           have "personality" and specialise in certain subjects, like holidays or cooking advice. It is the 
           latest salvo in a chatbot arms race between tech companies desperate to produce more accurate and 
           personalised artificial intelligence. The chatbots are still a work in progress with "limitations",
            said boss Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

        <h2>PlayStation boss Jim Ryan to retire from Sony next year</h2>
        <p><img class="elementimg" src="ryan.jpg" alt="Jim Ryan">
        PlayStation boss Jim Ryan is to step down in March 2024 after almost 30 years with the company. 
        He took over as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) in February 2019, having joined Sony 
        a few months before the launch of the PlayStation in 1994. His departure comes as a shock after 
        the recent success of the PS5, which he has overseen since it launched in 2020. Mr Ryan said he 
        took the decision to leave over issues he had living in Europe while working in North America.</p>

        <h2>Amazon: US accuses online giant of illegal monopoly</h2>
        <p><img class="elementimg" src="amazon.jpg" alt="Amazon evelop">
        US regulators have sued Amazon, alleging that the internet giant is illegally maintaining monopoly power. 
        The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said Amazon uses "a set of interlocking anticompetitive and unfair strategies" 
        to push up prices and stifle competition. Amazon said the lawsuit was "wrong on the facts and law, and we look 
        forward to making that case in court". It is the latest technology giant to be sued by US regulators. The FTC's boss,
         Lina Khan, has had Amazon in her crosshairs for years. In 2017, Ms Khan, then only 29, published a major academic
          article arguing the online retailer had escaped anti-competition scrutiny. "With its missionary zeal for consumers, 
          Amazon has marched toward monopoly," she said at the time.</p>
